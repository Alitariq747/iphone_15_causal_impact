## Results

The detailed Impact can be found at the end of the study. In a nut shell our analysis show that the launch of iphone 15 series had a negative impact on Apple stock prices. It can be argued that many other factors could 
also be reponsible which were not held constant; however the results of the study were statistically significant. Results indicate that stock price could potentially be higher had the launch not taken place.
